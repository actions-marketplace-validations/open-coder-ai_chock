"""The surface vocabulary alone, with no dependencies, so naming one costs no imports.

Held apart from `surfaces`, which derives per-agent membership and therefore reaches the
installer and the vendor matrix. A module that only needs to say "ambient-rule" should not
pull that in behind it -- doing so is what made config, the gate builder and the in-agent
emitter into an import cycle.
